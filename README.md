In this project we use **OpenCV** and **Pickle** that is used to serialize and deserialize objects in Python. `Pickle` is used to save and load trained machine 
learning models for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.

For this project, we analyze how many pixels are in every parking lot and when the pixels count is less than the parameter (in this case *300* pixels) means that the 
parking lot is free.

Finally, other library used in this project is *cvzone*. This library is built on top OpenCV that provides a set of useful computer vision functions and utilities to simplify
the development of computer vision applications.
